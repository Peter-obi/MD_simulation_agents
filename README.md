# PDB-info-extraction-from-RCSB-PDB
Get PDB ids and other needed information like resolution, year deposited, pubmed doi and id using the RCSB PDB API and python.
There are 2 scripts, one for general search and one that looks for membrane annotations and works well for membrane proteins. 
You can also remove the part of the code that only looks for homo sapiens if you are interested in all species.
