# Build llm agents
Given a uniprot ID, these agents should be able to run a simulation. First iteration will consider all things being equal, that is perfect protein with pdb structures etc. Other iterations will include checking for alphafold structures where available. User just has to specify length of uniprot ID and length of production run.
